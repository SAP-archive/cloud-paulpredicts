Application startup
-------------------

You can run PaulPredicts either locally, or on the Cloud.

1) Running locally
 - you have to create a new local server
 - double-click on it, Connectivity tab, create a new Destination, named "opta" and paste the following URL to the URL field:
 https://octopuspaul.hana.ondemand.com/ptodata/
 - if you work behind a proxy server, then you should configure your proxy settings (host and port). Double click on the server,
 go to Overview tab and press the Open launch configuration. In the tab (x)= Arguments, VM Arguments copy this:
 -Dhttp.proxyHost=<yourproxyHost> -Dhttp.proxyPort=<yourProxyPort> -Dhttps.proxyHost=<yourproxyHost> -Dhttps.proxyPort=<yourProxyPort> 
 and set your proxy hosts and ports 
 - create Local users - double-click on the created server, go to User tab and create new users with the properties required. Set a role for every of your users.
 Role with name "Everyone" is mandatory and if you want to use the admin UI, then add one more role, named "admin".
 - run MongoDB - it is used for the SAP HANA Cloud's Document Service when running it locally. Download MongoDB from here: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads,
 save the archive, unpack and execute the following command: mongod --dbpath C:\mongodb_data, where "C:\mongodb_data" is an empty directory
 
 Note: when running locally you will receive the mails on your local file system. In your local server's folder/work/mailservice/
 - Run the application
 
 2) Running on the Cloud
 - create a server on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform
 - double-click on it, Connectivity tab, create a new Destination, named "opta" and paste the following URL to the URL field:
 https://octopuspaul.hana.ondemand.com/ptodata/
 - for using the Mail Service you have got to complete a put-destination operation with a specially prepared file (you can find one in the current directory,
 named Session.template). Remove the .template extension(!) and fill in data regarding SMTP, username, password etc for you email account.
 The put-destination operation can be completed with the Console Client and with a special properties file, containing information about your SAP HANA Cloud account 
 (you can also find this template in the same folder). Fill in the template and enter the following command in the Console Client: neo put-destination <path to the file with properties>
 - assign your user a specific role - go to the accounts page, Authorizations tab, select application from the combo box and the available roles will appear on the right.
 Choose Users from the combo box below and assign the desired role.
 - Run the application

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP HANA Cloud - Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
